# Performance of Open-Source Large Language Models in Smart Contract Vulnerability Detection

**🔬 An Open-Source Project for Evaluating LLMs in Smart Contract Vulnerability Detection**  
**📅 Project Status: Research Completed, All experimental data and methods are open source.**

---

## 📖 Project Overview

This project provides a comprehensive evaluation of the performance of state-of-the-art open-source Large Language Models (LLMs) in detecting smart contract vulnerabilities. As smart contracts become more prevalent, their security is paramount. Traditional detection methods have limitations, and this research explores the potential of LLMs as a powerful alternative.

We focus on three key areas:
1.  Evaluating the effectiveness of prominent open-source LLMs in detecting various vulnerabilities.
2.  Comparing their performance with existing, traditional detection tools.
3.  Analyzing their limitations and potential for future development.

This repository contains all the experimental methods and data, aiming to foster further research and development in smart contract security.

## 📌 Key Components

- 🧐 **Evaluated LLMs**: We assessed four powerful open-source models of varying scales.
  - `gpt-oss 20B`
  - `gpt-oss 120B`
  - `Qwen3 235B`
  - `DeepSeek R1 671B`
- 📊 **Evaluation Dataset**: All experiments are conducted on the widely-used `Smartbugs` dataset.
- 🤖 **Comparative Analysis**: We provide a detailed comparison against ten mainstream smart contract vulnerability detection tools.
- 🌐 **Open-Source Data & Methods**: To promote transparency and further research, all experimental setups, scripts, and results are made publicly available.
